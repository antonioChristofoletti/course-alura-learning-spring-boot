## Setup

I didn't configure the application for the deployment in any platform. So, the current way to execute the API is through
`Main Application`: `ForumApplication` and `SpringBootAdminApplication`.

## Features

`API with` standard features, such as:

- `API` documentation auto generated by `Spring Fox (Swagger)`;
- `API` with environment profiles, such as, test, dev and prod/
- `API` with unitary tests;
- `API` Admin Interface by `Spring Boot Admin`;
- Database integration through `ORM (Hibernate)`;
- `JWT` authentication;
- `End-points` with data validators with `Java Beans Validators`;
- `End-points` with cache system and pagination;
- `End-points` and static resources with authentication polices and rules;
- `Deploy` configuration with `Docker`.

## Status

Concluded. There is no indicates for futures developments.
